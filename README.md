## Summary 

While the NYC Citibike data shows the bike-sharing business as a profitable business, it's essential to consider that the NYC population differs from Des Moines'. According to the Census Bureau, in July of 2019, the NYC population was 8,336,817 people, while in Des Moines, the population was 214,237. For further analysis, it would be relevant to analyze the cold-weather performance of the business and proximity to the users' work. Since based on the peak hours per day, it looks like mornings and evenings seem to be busy in the bike-sharing company, suggesting that many users may utilize the service as a means of transportation to work.
